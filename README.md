# Sports Betting Analysis Project

This was my third project from the [Metis Data Science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps). 

This analysis used Python's scikit-learn package to perform logistic regression, random forest classifier, extra trees classifier, and Gaussian naive bayes to predict if a team would cover the point spread.

The results were encouraging, with logistic regression predicting the correct outcome with an accuracy score of nearly 55 percent on the test data set.

The best features were chosen from hundreds generated.

And a visualization of how the different algorithms performed over time.
