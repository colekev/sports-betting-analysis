# Sports Betting Analysis Project

This was my third project from the [Metis Data Science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps). 

This analysis used Python's sciket-learn package to perform logisitic regression, random forest classifer, extra trees classifer, and Gaussian navie bayes to predict if a team would cover the point spread.

The results were encouraging, with logistic regression predicting the correct outcome with an accurary score of nearly 55 percent on the test data set.
