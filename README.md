# Sports Betting Analysis Project

This was my third project from the [Metis Data Science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps). 

This analysis used Python's sciket-learn package to perform logisitic regression, random forest classifer, extra trees classifer, and Gaussian navie bayes to predict if a team would cover the point spread.

The results were encouraging, with logistic regression predicting the correct outcome with an accurary score of nearly 55 percent on the test data set.

The best features were chosen from hundreds generated.
